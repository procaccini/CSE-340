How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  There are 3 mains keys for me. The first part of this is being consistant in my coding. I try to to change up to many things when I am coding. I dont want to hardcode some things and then use something "pluggable" later. Being consistant throught my whole process is a key for me. This leads into my second piece of documentation. I will try to add notes throught my code as I go through it. This make the code eaiser to understand hopefully and should allow for someone else to know what I am doing. This is not limited to me just saying what the code is doing. At times, I will also add my thoughts in as why I did it the way I did. This can allow someone else or me to know my thought process. If needing to update or rewrite, it should help. The final piece that I do is "test". Throughout my code, I will have random pieces print out. While I am building, this is for two reasons. First, it allows me to see what is being done. If I am getting the wrong data, I know where to look. Secondly, it helps me with debugging. It i know the last piece that was printed, then I know where to look to see where the code is breaking. I do everything this way. Since I first began doing coding, I would always write this way after my first project. You slowly begin to know what works and doesnt work for youself. I have just stuck to this.







How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  Again, as I stated above, I work the same way through everything. This is what works for me and until I can better it, I dont plan to change it. The nice part about our assignements, is that it is broken down how I would do the projects myslef. I figure out what is needed and make that into a list. That list, has priority items. The priority depends on many different factors dpending on all of the information that I am given. Then I work step by step through that list. Once an item is "done", I make sure that it is working as expected. Then I move on through the list. This process works and can show how I am moving through a project and my process. I currently have one ongoing at work that I was given. I need to make 2 major changes to it. The issue is one of them is simple and the other is more complex. I am going to update the report with the simple information and get that into production. This will allow other teams to be more productive while I try to solve the second issue. Always be flexable when you are working.







What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  To put it simple, we use computers to solve problems as efficiently and effectively as we can. To apply this to Grazioso Salvare, we can take all of their data and put it into a database. We then can use that database to answer questions or pull information that would be needed. Without a database, they would have to have another way of storing their information and answer what they need to. This more than likly would be a manaual process that would take tons of hours to do. W4e as computer scientist could do that same amount of work, in a fration of the time and move onto the next process. It allow the company to be more efficent and efftive.
